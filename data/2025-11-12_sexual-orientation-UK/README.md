# Sexual Orientation UK

This monthâ€™s datasets are from the Office for National Statistics in the UK. The data is on sexual orientation in the UK from 2012 to 2019 by region, sex, age, marital status, ethnicity and National Statistics Socio-economic classification. 

Sexual orientation is an umbrella concept which encapsulates sexual identity, behaviour and attraction. The measurement of sexual identity has been identified as the component of sexual orientation most closely related to experiences of disadvantage and discrimination. 

Sexual identity does not necessarily reflect sexual attraction and/or sexual behaviour which are separate concepts currently not measured by the Annual Population Survey (APS). These tables have been constructed using estimates from the APS, of self perceived sexual identity from the household population aged 16 and over in the UK.

									

## About the data (values are in thousands)
The data was divided into 7 files which include the following: 

- Table 1: Sexual Identity by Region and Country	
- Table 2: Sexual Identity by Sex		
- Table 3: Sexual Identity by Age		
- Table 4: Sexual Identity by NS-SEC (National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification)		
- Table 5: Legal Marital Status by Sexual Identity		
- Table 6: Sexual Identity by Ethnicity		
- Table 7: Sexual Identity by Age and Sex	


## Why this is relevant 

It is interesting to know absolute numbers of people in the LGBTQ+ community but who are the people that make up those numbers? Are there systematic differences between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ people in terms of age, sex and ethnicity? Questions like these can be answered using data such as the data from this data set. Compared to last month's data set, this data is quite simple but no less valuable. What interesting facts about LGBTQ+ people in the UK can you discover?
