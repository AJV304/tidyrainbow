# Sexual Orientation UK

The datasets are from Office for Nationa Statistics. Data is on sexual orientation in the
UK from 2012 to 2019 by region, sex, age, marital status, ethnicity and 
National Statistics Socio-economic classification. Date of data is May 27, 2021.


Sexual orientation is an umbrella concept which encapsulates sexual identity, 
behaviour and attraction.										
The measurement of sexual identity has been identified as the component of sexual orientation most closely related to experiences of disadvantage and discrimination.										
Sexual identity does not necessarily reflect sexual attraction and/or sexual behaviour which are separate concepts currently not measured by the Annual Population Survey (APS).										
These tables have been constructed using estimates from the APS, of self perceived sexual identity from the household population aged 16 and over in the UK.
