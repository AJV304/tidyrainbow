# Rainbow Europe

The IGLA maps 49 European countries based on their LGBT laws and policies. They examine seven different categories using 75 criteria and give each country points and a consequent ranking. Rainbow Map ranks the countries on a scale between 0% (gross violations of human rights, discrimination) and 100% (respect of human rights, full equality). 

Their first ranking came out in 2009 where they used 13 criteria and they make use of the 0-100% percent ranking since 2013, making their data comparable. On their website they visualize the data through an interactive map which is available to play around with freely. The data can be organized per country and per category, we have provided the datasets per category for you below.

## Why this is relevant

Data can be visualized in many different ways, some more intuitive than others. Initiatives like the IGLA who use maps to showcase their data are often more easily interpretable for those less familiar with large data and statistics. Vizualizing data in maps can help people better understand what they are reading but it can also be misleading. If we represent small differences in the data with big differences in color on the map for example this can be misunderstood. Therefore, it is important to understand how data relates to its visualization, why not have a look at the IGLA website and try to see if you can relate this data to their map!
