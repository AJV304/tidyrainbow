# Gender-based violence and unwanted sexual behaviour in Canada, 2018

The purpose of this survey is to collect information on Canadians' experiences related to their safety in public and private spaces. This survey was conducted in 2018 and Statistics Canada is currently working on an updated version for 2025/2026. 

The sample of the survey constitutes all non-institutionalized persons 15 years of age or older, living in the 10 provinces or 3 territories of Canada. A sample of 106,000 units was selected from the frame using stratified random sampling. The stratification is done at the province/census metropolitan area (CMA) level. 

The data concerns the percentage of the sample that has experienced unwanted sexual behavior in public spaces/online, subdivided based on characteristics of the sample. 


## About the data 

The sample size for the 10 provinces was 43,296 respondents. 
The overall response rate was 43.1%. Non-respondents included people who refused to participate, could not be reached, or could not speak English or French. Respondents in the sample were weighted so that their responses represent the non-institutionalized Canadian population aged 15 and older.

Missing values or `F` ratings from `StatsCan` were excluded, as well as the 95% Confidence Intervals in the original archived dataset.

The data is presented in percentage of the sample. The sample is divided along multiple characteristics and per category the percentage of unwanted sexual behavior online and in public spaces is reported.

## Why this is relevant

The LGBTQ+ community faces an above average risk of unwanted sexual behavior. As minorities, LGBTQ+ people might be more vulnerable to be taken advantage of and put in apprehensive situations. This is a sad but harsh reality. In order to stand up for LGTBQ+ rights, it is important to understand which issues the community faces and which risks are associated with being LGBTQ+. Data such as these can help illustrate the problem. The originators of this study found that gay, lesbian, bisexual and other sexual minority people in Canada were almost three times more likely than heterosexual Canadians to report that they had been physically or sexually assaulted, are you able to reproduce this finding?
