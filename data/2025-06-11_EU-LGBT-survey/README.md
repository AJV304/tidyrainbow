# EU LGBT Survery

FRA (Fundamental Rights Agency) conducted an online survey to identify how lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people living in the European Union and Croatia experience the fulfillment of their fundamental rights. The evidence produced by the survey will support the development of more effective laws and policies to fight discrimination, violence and harassment, improving equal treatment across society. The need for such an EU-wide survey became evident after the publication in 2009 of the first FRA report on homophobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, which highlighted the absence of comparable data. The European Commission then requested FRA to collect comparable data across the EU on this issue. FRA organised the data collection in the form of an online survey covering all EU Member States and Croatia. The respondents were persons aged 18 years and over, who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, anonymously. The survey was made available online, from April to July 2012, in all 23 official EU languages (except Irish) plus Catalan, Croatian, Luxembourgish, Russian and Turkish. In total, 93,079 LGBT persons completed the survey. FRAâ€™s inhouse experts designed the survey which was implemented by Gallup, one of the market leaders in large-scale surveys. In addition, civil society organisations including ILGA-Europe (European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) and Transgender Europe (TGEU) provided advice on how to best approach LGBT people.

## Why this is relevant 

The LGBTQ+ community is broad and varied but not always visible. Questionnaires like these allow us to get a look into the lives of this population. Not only does the questionnaire allow us to better estimate the number of LGTBQ+ people living in the EU and how they identify but it also allows us to have a look at their quality of life. Because even though the community might be more visible than ever, this does not automatically mean that the people are doing better. It is important to look at how being LGBTQ+ might impact lives in terms of harassment but also happiness, depression and whether people feel allowed to be open about their identity. These questionnaires allow us to look at the personal lives and struggles of LGBTQ+ people and the issues that this particular community and its sub-communities face.
