# LA LGBTQ+ Resources

This dataset is about resources for LGBTQ persons across the Los Angeles County, including health, housing and education. Columns with contact information were removed for safety of the resources centers included in the dataset. The data originates from the city controller and is dated June, 10, 2020. The dataset has 124 observations across 5 categories, making this one of the smaller data sets weâ€™ve uploaded. This can provide a nice challenge; what analyses can I run/are of interest within my limited dataset? #TidyRainbow encourages you to explore what you can find!

## Why this is relevant

Most of our data sets up till now have focused on data about LGBTQ+ people. Whether this be how people identify, what contraceptives they use or what issues they face. This data set is about what resources exist to *help* the community. It is important to focus not just on what is going on in the people within the community but also on which structures exist to support the community. This data set helps illustrate that for LA. Do you know what types of resources are available for LGBTQ+ people in your area? Why not have a look!
