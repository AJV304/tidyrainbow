## A weekly social data project in R

A weekly data project aimed at the LGBTQ+ community who use the R language ecosystem.
This is borne out of the lack of LGBTQ+ representation in the widely used datasets in data science. This project is a version of the `R4DS Online Learning Community` repository, where using the `tidyverse` libraries are encouraged and where code is shared. The goal is to use your `R for Data Science` skills and share your insights with the world.

 Join the weekly `#TidyRainbow` event! Each we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset 
 and ask that you explore the data. The data will not always be tidy but steps will be taken to try. 




---
The datasets in this repository are with an emphasis of data that is **not binary in gender and where sexuality is beyond the assumption of heterosexuality, where LGBTQ+ people/persons are explicitly included**. 

--- 
We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts and experts

Things to remember:

  1. The data come from the source or where the article sites/ credits, so 
  data will not be 100% clean 100% of the time
  
  2. This data is meant for understanding the intersectionality of the global LGBTQ+ 
  community, where injustices, civil rights, healthcare, politics, 
  etc and to learn from it
  
  3. This repository is not about any criticism or bigotry.
  
  4. Use the hashtag #TidyRainbow when you finish your data science work, 
  if you choose to share it
  
  5. Include a picture image of your data visualization (be colorful!)
  
  6. Include a link to your code, so others can learn from you.
  
  7. Focus on learning something from the data


## Submitting Datasets

If you found a dataset that is LGBTQ+ inclusive:

### Contribute

1. Make an issue

TL;DR on what to write

- **Type of data**, what is on x-axis? what is on y-axis?
- **Why** , why you made the plot graphic
- **Link** , link to the data or source
